# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to **LeetCode** problems in Python (and occasionally SQL).  Each problem is organized in its own folder, named with the problem ID and a short description (e.g., `0001-two-sum`, `0058-length-of-last-word`, etc.) [oai_citation:18‡github.com](https://github.com/kanavgoyal781/lc#:~:text=0001).  Inside each folder you’ll typically find:

- `solution.py` – my Python solution with comments.
- `README.md` – a brief explanation of the problem and my approach (when applicable).
- Additional files, such as `solution.sql` or test cases, if the problem involves SQL or other formats.

## How to use this repo

1. **Browse by problem number.**  The directories are sorted by problem ID.  For example, `0001-two-sum` contains my solution for the “Two Sum” problem.
2. **Run a solution.**  Navigate to a problem’s folder and run the Python script:

   ```bash
   cd 0001-two-sum
   python solution.py
